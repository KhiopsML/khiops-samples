Bad Flight	@VirginAmerica Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego.
Cancelled Flight	@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time.
Bad Flight	@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
Late Flight	@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
Cancelled Flight	@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
Bad Flight	@VirginAmerica mood lighting on point🙌 Reclining my seat, kickin up my feet💤
Late Flight	@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
Customer Service Issue	@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 😡
Cancelled Flight	@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
Late Flight	@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
Bad Flight	@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock.
Customer Service Issue	@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
Customer Service Issue	@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!
Lost Luggage	@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child
Customer Service Issue	@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
Customer Service Issue	@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner.
Customer Service Issue	@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
Customer Service Issue	@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
Late Flight	@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
Customer Service Issue	@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but...
Customer Service Issue	@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
Customer Service Issue	@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
Cancelled Flight	@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
Lost Luggage	@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
Late Flight	@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
Late Flight	@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
Lost Luggage	@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
Lost Luggage	@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
Customer Service Issue	@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
Customer Service Issue	@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
Customer Service Issue	@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
Customer Service Issue	"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
Cancelled Flight	@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
Late Flight	@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
Customer Service Issue	@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
Customer Service Issue	@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
Customer Service Issue	@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
Customer Service Issue	@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you 😢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
Customer Service Issue	@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
Lost Luggage	@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
Customer Service Issue	@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
Late Flight	@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
Bad Flight	@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
Late Flight	@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
Late Flight	@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
Customer Service Issue	@united crashed trying to check in.
Customer Service Issue	@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam

Customer Service Issue	@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
Customer Service Issue	@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
Lost Luggage	@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
Bad Flight	@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
Late Flight	@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
Bad Flight	@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
Customer Service Issue	@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
Customer Service Issue	@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
Customer Service Issue	@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
Customer Service Issue	@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
Customer Service Issue	.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
Customer Service Issue	@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
Lost Luggage	@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
Late Flight	@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
Customer Service Issue	@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
Customer Service Issue	@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
Bad Flight	@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
Lost Luggage	@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
Customer Service Issue	@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.

Bad Flight	@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
Customer Service Issue	@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
Cancelled Flight	@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
Customer Service Issue	@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
Bad Flight	@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fiancée and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The

Lost Luggage	@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines
Late Flight	@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
Customer Service Issue	@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
Customer Service Issue	@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
Lost Luggage	@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
Customer Service Issue	@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
Lost Luggage	@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
Customer Service Issue	@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
Lost Luggage	@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
Customer Service Issue	@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
Lost Luggage	@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
Customer Service Issue	@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
Customer Service Issue	@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
Late Flight	@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
Customer Service Issue	@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
Lost Luggage	@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
Lost Luggage	@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
Cancelled Flight	@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
Lost Luggage	@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!
Lost Luggage	@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
Customer Service Issue	@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
Late Flight	@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
Customer Service Issue	@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
Bad Flight	@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
Lost Luggage	@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
Cancelled Flight	@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
Customer Service Issue	@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
Customer Service Issue	@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
Late Flight	@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
Lost Luggage	@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
Customer Service Issue	@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
Lost Luggage	@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
Lost Luggage	@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
Customer Service Issue	@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
Customer Service Issue	@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
Customer Service Issue	@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
Late Flight	@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
Customer Service Issue	"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
Customer Service Issue	@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!
Late Flight	@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
Late Flight	Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
Lost Luggage	@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
Cancelled Flight	@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
Customer Service Issue	“@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
Late Flight	"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
Late Flight	@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
Late Flight	@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
Cancelled Flight	@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
Lost Luggage	@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
Lost Luggage	@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
Customer Service Issue	@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
Customer Service Issue	@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
Late Flight	@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
Customer Service Issue	@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
Cancelled Flight	@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
Customer Service Issue	@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
Late Flight	@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
Customer Service Issue	@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
Cancelled Flight	@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like
Cancelled Flight	@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
Lost Luggage	@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags.
Customer Service Issue	"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
Customer Service Issue	@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
Lost Luggage	@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
Customer Service Issue	@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
Lost Luggage	@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
Lost Luggage	@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
Lost Luggage	@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
Late Flight	@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
Lost Luggage	@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
Late Flight	@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
Lost Luggage	@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
Bad Flight	@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
Late Flight	@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
Late Flight	@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
Bad Flight	@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
Customer Service Issue	@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
Late Flight	@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
Cancelled Flight	@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
Customer Service Issue	@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
Customer Service Issue	@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
Customer Service Issue	@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated—my time wasted (2/2)
Customer Service Issue	@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
Late Flight	@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
Late Flight	@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
Bad Flight	@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
Late Flight	@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
Customer Service Issue	@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
Lost Luggage	@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
Lost Luggage	@united GRK13575M is the file reference
Customer Service Issue	@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
Bad Flight	@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
Customer Service Issue	@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
Bad Flight	@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
Cancelled Flight	@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
Lost Luggage	@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
Lost Luggage	@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
Lost Luggage	@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
Lost Luggage	@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!
Lost Luggage	@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
Customer Service Issue	@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
Lost Luggage	@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
Lost Luggage	@united where's my damn bag??
Lost Luggage	@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
Customer Service Issue	@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
Cancelled Flight	@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
Customer Service Issue	@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
Bad Flight	@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
Cancelled Flight	@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
Late Flight	@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
Customer Service Issue	@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
Customer Service Issue	@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
Bad Flight	@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
Lost Luggage	@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
Customer Service Issue	@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
Customer Service Issue	@united So you are inadequate by accident?
Customer Service Issue	@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
Bad Flight	@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
Customer Service Issue	@united ...and when that doesn't work...
Lost Luggage	@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
Lost Luggage	@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
Lost Luggage	@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
Bad Flight	@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
Customer Service Issue	@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
Customer Service Issue	@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
Cancelled Flight	@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
Customer Service Issue	@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
Cancelled Flight	@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
Customer Service Issue	@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
Customer Service Issue	@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
Customer Service Issue	@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
Bad Flight	@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
Lost Luggage	@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
Cancelled Flight	@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
Customer Service Issue	@united I did... no response back
Customer Service Issue	@united this is atrocious customer service.
Late Flight	@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
Cancelled Flight	@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
Customer Service Issue	@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
Lost Luggage	@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
Customer Service Issue	@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
Customer Service Issue	@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
Bad Flight	@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
Late Flight	@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
Lost Luggage	@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
Late Flight	@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
Lost Luggage	@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
Late Flight	@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
Late Flight	@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
Customer Service Issue	@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people
Late Flight	@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
Late Flight	@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
Customer Service Issue	@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
Lost Luggage	@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
Customer Service Issue	@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
Late Flight	@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
Cancelled Flight	@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
Customer Service Issue	@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
Cancelled Flight	@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
Late Flight	@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
Customer Service Issue	@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
Lost Luggage	@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
Lost Luggage	@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
Bad Flight	@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
Late Flight	@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
Lost Luggage	@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
Lost Luggage	"@united This must be a drone “@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
Customer Service Issue	@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
Customer Service Issue	@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
Late Flight	@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
Customer Service Issue	@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents 👿
Customer Service Issue	@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
Cancelled Flight	@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?
Customer Service Issue	@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
Late Flight	@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
Bad Flight	@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
Customer Service Issue	@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
Late Flight	@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
Customer Service Issue	@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
Late Flight	@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
Bad Flight	@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
Lost Luggage	@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
Late Flight	@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
Late Flight	@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
Late Flight	@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
Customer Service Issue	@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
Late Flight	@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
Cancelled Flight	@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
Late Flight	@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
Late Flight	@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
Bad Flight	@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
Bad Flight	@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
Customer Service Issue	@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
Cancelled Flight	@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
Lost Luggage	The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
Customer Service Issue	@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
Cancelled Flight	@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
Cancelled Flight	@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
Late Flight	@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
Customer Service Issue	@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
Late Flight	@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
Customer Service Issue	@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
Cancelled Flight	@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
Late Flight	@united already missed  connection ugh
Customer Service Issue	@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
Late Flight	@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
Bad Flight	@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
Late Flight	@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
Customer Service Issue	@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
Bad Flight	@united that's cool - now what?
Customer Service Issue	@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
Late Flight	@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
Cancelled Flight	@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?
Bad Flight	@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
Cancelled Flight	@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
Bad Flight	@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!
Customer Service Issue	"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
Customer Service Issue	@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
Late Flight	"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
Late Flight	@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
Late Flight	"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
Customer Service Issue	"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
Customer Service Issue	@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
Late Flight	@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
Lost Luggage	@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
Customer Service Issue	@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
Cancelled Flight	@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?
Cancelled Flight	"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
Late Flight	@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
Late Flight	@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
Late Flight	@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
Customer Service Issue	@united it won't help...been there done that.
Customer Service Issue	@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
Customer Service Issue	@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
Customer Service Issue	@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
Cancelled Flight	@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.
Cancelled Flight	@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
Customer Service Issue	@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
Late Flight	@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? 😭
Late Flight	@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
Cancelled Flight	@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
Late Flight	@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
Late Flight	@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
Late Flight	@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
Late Flight	@united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
Late Flight	@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
Late Flight	@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.

Customer Service Issue	@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!

Customer Service Issue	@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
Customer Service Issue	"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
Bad Flight	@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
Customer Service Issue	@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
Customer Service Issue	@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
Late Flight	@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
Customer Service Issue	@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
Late Flight	@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
Customer Service Issue	@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
Lost Luggage	@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
Customer Service Issue	@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
Late Flight	@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!

Customer Service Issue	@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
Bad Flight	"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."

Late Flight	@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
Customer Service Issue	@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
Customer Service Issue	@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
Cancelled Flight	@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
Cancelled Flight	@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
Late Flight	@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?
Cancelled Flight	@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
Customer Service Issue	@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet
Late Flight	@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
Cancelled Flight	@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
Customer Service Issue	@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
Lost Luggage	@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
Bad Flight	@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
Bad Flight	@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
Bad Flight	@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
Lost Luggage	@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
Customer Service Issue	@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
Cancelled Flight	@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
Customer Service Issue	@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
Bad Flight	@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
Lost Luggage	@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
Customer Service Issue	@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
Late Flight	@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
Lost Luggage	@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
Customer Service Issue	@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
Late Flight	@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
Customer Service Issue	@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
Late Flight	@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
Customer Service Issue	@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
Customer Service Issue	@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
Customer Service Issue	@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
Customer Service Issue	@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
Bad Flight	@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
Late Flight	@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
Lost Luggage	@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
Late Flight	@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...

Lost Luggage	@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
Lost Luggage	@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
Customer Service Issue	@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
Late Flight	@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
Late Flight	@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
Lost Luggage	@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
Customer Service Issue	@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
Customer Service Issue	@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
Customer Service Issue	@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
Late Flight	@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
Customer Service Issue	@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
Customer Service Issue	@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
Late Flight	@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
Late Flight	@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail

Late Flight	@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
Late Flight	@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
Late Flight	@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
Customer Service Issue	@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
Customer Service Issue	"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
Customer Service Issue	@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
Late Flight	@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
Lost Luggage	@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
Late Flight	@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
Late Flight	@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
Cancelled Flight	@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
Lost Luggage	@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
Bad Flight	@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
Late Flight	@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
Customer Service Issue	@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
Late Flight	@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
Late Flight	@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
Late Flight	@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
Customer Service Issue	@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
Customer Service Issue	@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
Bad Flight	@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
Customer Service Issue	@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
Customer Service Issue	@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
Customer Service Issue	@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
Customer Service Issue	@united lol too little too Late Flight
Lost Luggage	@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
Late Flight	@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
Customer Service Issue	@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
Late Flight	@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
Late Flight	@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
Bad Flight	@united your seats are god awful.
Customer Service Issue	@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
Late Flight	@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
Bad Flight	@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
Late Flight	@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?
Late Flight	@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.
Customer Service Issue	@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
Customer Service Issue	@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
Cancelled Flight	@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
Late Flight	@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
Bad Flight	@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
Late Flight	@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
Lost Luggage	@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
Lost Luggage	@united I need help with a missing bag.
Late Flight	@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
Late Flight	@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
Late Flight	@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
Customer Service Issue	@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
Customer Service Issue	@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
Late Flight	@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
Lost Luggage	@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
Lost Luggage	@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
Lost Luggage	@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
Late Flight	@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
Late Flight	@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
Customer Service Issue	@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?
Customer Service Issue	@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!

Late Flight	@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
Bad Flight	@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
Late Flight	.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
Late Flight	@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
Late Flight	@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
Late Flight	@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
Lost Luggage	@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
Lost Luggage	@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
Customer Service Issue	@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
Customer Service Issue	@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
Late Flight	@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
Late Flight	@united false.
Customer Service Issue	@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
Customer Service Issue	.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
Late Flight	@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.

Bad Flight	@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
Customer Service Issue	@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
Bad Flight	@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
Late Flight	@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
Cancelled Flight	@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?

Cancelled Flight	"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
Late Flight	"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
Late Flight	@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
Bad Flight	@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
Late Flight	@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!

Late Flight	@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
Late Flight	@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
Lost Luggage	@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
Customer Service Issue	@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
Customer Service Issue	@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
Customer Service Issue	@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
Customer Service Issue	@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
Cancelled Flight	@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
Late Flight	"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
Bad Flight	@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
Customer Service Issue	@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
Bad Flight	@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
Bad Flight	@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...✈️

Late Flight	@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
Cancelled Flight	@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
Bad Flight	@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
Late Flight	@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable.
Customer Service Issue	@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
Bad Flight	@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
Late Flight	@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
Bad Flight	"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
Customer Service Issue	@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
Cancelled Flight	@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.

Cancelled Flight	@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
Customer Service Issue	@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
Lost Luggage	@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
Bad Flight	@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
Lost Luggage	@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer

Customer Service Issue	@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
Customer Service Issue	@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc

Late Flight	@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!
Late Flight	@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
Customer Service Issue	@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
Customer Service Issue	@united   There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
Lost Luggage	@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
Late Flight	@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
Late Flight	@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
Lost Luggage	@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
Cancelled Flight	@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
Customer Service Issue	@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
Late Flight	@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??
Customer Service Issue	@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
Bad Flight	@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
Customer Service Issue	@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
Customer Service Issue	@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
Lost Luggage	@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them.
Late Flight	@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
Customer Service Issue	@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
Customer Service Issue	@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
Lost Luggage	@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
Customer Service Issue	Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
Lost Luggage	@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
Late Flight	@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
Customer Service Issue	@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid

Late Flight	@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
Customer Service Issue	@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
Bad Flight	@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
Lost Luggage	@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
Cancelled Flight	@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
Customer Service Issue	"@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show"""
Late Flight	@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
Lost Luggage	@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
Late Flight	@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
Customer Service Issue	@united direct messages not going through please help
Cancelled Flight	@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
Customer Service Issue	@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
Customer Service Issue	@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
Lost Luggage	@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
Late Flight	@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai
Late Flight	@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
Customer Service Issue	@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
Cancelled Flight	@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
Late Flight	@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
Customer Service Issue	@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
Bad Flight	@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs
Bad Flight	@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
Late Flight	@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
Lost Luggage	@united not my luggage
Late Flight	@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
Cancelled Flight	@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
Lost Luggage	@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
Late Flight	@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
Late Flight	@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
Customer Service Issue	@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
Late Flight	@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
Cancelled Flight	@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
Cancelled Flight	@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
Late Flight	@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
Cancelled Flight	@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
Lost Luggage	@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
Customer Service Issue	@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
Late Flight	@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together
Cancelled Flight	@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
Customer Service Issue	@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
Cancelled Flight	@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
Cancelled Flight	@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
Cancelled Flight	@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
Customer Service Issue	@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
Lost Luggage	@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
Cancelled Flight	@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
Customer Service Issue	@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've
Cancelled Flight	@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
Late Flight	.@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO
Customer Service Issue	"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
Customer Service Issue	@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
Customer Service Issue	@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
Customer Service Issue	@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
Late Flight	@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
Customer Service Issue	@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
Late Flight	@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
Bad Flight	@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
Customer Service Issue	@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
Cancelled Flight	@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
Customer Service Issue	@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..

Bad Flight	@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
Late Flight	@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
Customer Service Issue	@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
Late Flight	@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
Lost Luggage	@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
Cancelled Flight	@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
Customer Service Issue	@united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
Customer Service Issue	@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
Lost Luggage	@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
Lost Luggage	@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
Late Flight	@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but...
Lost Luggage	@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
Customer Service Issue	@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
Lost Luggage	@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
Customer Service Issue	@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
Late Flight	@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
Lost Luggage	@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
Late Flight	@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow

Customer Service Issue	@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?

Customer Service Issue	@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
Late Flight	@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?
Bad Flight	@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
Customer Service Issue	"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
Late Flight	@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
Customer Service Issue	@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp

Customer Service Issue	@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
Cancelled Flight	@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?

Bad Flight	@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
Cancelled Flight	@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
Lost Luggage	@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
Late Flight	@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
Customer Service Issue	@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.
Customer Service Issue	@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
Lost Luggage	Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
Customer Service Issue	@united you hung up on me again.
Customer Service Issue	"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
Customer Service Issue	@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
Late Flight	@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
Customer Service Issue	@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
Lost Luggage	.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
Customer Service Issue	@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
Lost Luggage	@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
Bad Flight	@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
Customer Service Issue	@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
Customer Service Issue	@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
Customer Service Issue	@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
Bad Flight	@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
Late Flight	@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
Bad Flight	@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
Late Flight	@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
Late Flight	@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
Lost Luggage	@united where is our luggage
Late Flight	@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
Bad Flight	@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
Cancelled Flight	@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
Lost Luggage	@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
Bad Flight	@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?
Customer Service Issue	@united that's not an apology. Say it.
Customer Service Issue	@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
Customer Service Issue	@united no apology? Cool.
Customer Service Issue	@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
Lost Luggage	@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
Lost Luggage	@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
Late Flight	@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
Customer Service Issue	@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
Customer Service Issue	@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.

Bad Flight	@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
Bad Flight	@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
Late Flight	@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
Late Flight	@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards

Customer Service Issue	@united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
Customer Service Issue	@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?
Bad Flight	@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
Late Flight	@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
Late Flight	@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
Cancelled Flight	@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
Bad Flight	@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
Late Flight	@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
Bad Flight	@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
Lost Luggage	@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
Customer Service Issue	@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!

Customer Service Issue	.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
Cancelled Flight	@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
Late Flight	@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help

Lost Luggage	@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
Customer Service Issue	@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
Bad Flight	@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out
Late Flight	@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
Late Flight	@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc

Lost Luggage	@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
Late Flight	@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies

Lost Luggage	@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
Bad Flight	@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
Late Flight	Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
Bad Flight	@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
Late Flight	@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
Customer Service Issue	@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
Bad Flight	@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
Cancelled Flight	@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
Lost Luggage	@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
Customer Service Issue	@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
Bad Flight	@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
Customer Service Issue	@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
Customer Service Issue	@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.

Bad Flight	@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
Bad Flight	@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW

Cancelled Flight	@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
Bad Flight	@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
Bad Flight	@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
Cancelled Flight	@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
Customer Service Issue	@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?

Customer Service Issue	@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
Customer Service Issue	@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
Customer Service Issue	@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage
Bad Flight	@united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites
Late Flight	@United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog
Customer Service Issue	@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins

Late Flight	@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
Late Flight	@united  Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience
Customer Service Issue	@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
Customer Service Issue	"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."

Customer Service Issue	@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
Customer Service Issue	@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
Customer Service Issue	@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
Customer Service Issue	@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
Lost Luggage	@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
Cancelled Flight	@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.

Cancelled Flight	@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
Customer Service Issue	@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours

Customer Service Issue	@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
Customer Service Issue	@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
Bad Flight	@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
Cancelled Flight	@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough
Late Flight	@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
Bad Flight	@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information.
Customer Service Issue	@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
Customer Service Issue	@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
Late Flight	@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
Bad Flight	@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
Late Flight	@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
Late Flight	@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
Customer Service Issue	@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
Customer Service Issue	@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
Customer Service Issue	"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
Customer Service Issue	@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
Lost Luggage	@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
Customer Service Issue	@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember
Customer Service Issue	@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
Late Flight	@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
Late Flight	@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
Customer Service Issue	@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
Late Flight	@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
Customer Service Issue	@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
Customer Service Issue	@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
Late Flight	@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
Customer Service Issue	@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
Bad Flight	@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
Late Flight	@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
Late Flight	@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157

Bad Flight	@united DTV doesnt work, pilots Late Flight, wont let 10yr old fly next 2 me and I paid 4 an upgrade. #unitedsucks
Customer Service Issue	"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
Bad Flight	Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
Customer Service Issue	"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
Customer Service Issue	. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
Late Flight	@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
Late Flight	@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
Late Flight	@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
Lost Luggage	@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
Late Flight	@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
Late Flight	@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
Late Flight	"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
Late Flight	@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
Customer Service Issue	@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
Bad Flight	@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
Lost Luggage	@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
Customer Service Issue	@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
Bad Flight	@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
Late Flight	@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
Customer Service Issue	@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
Late Flight	@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
Late Flight	@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
Bad Flight	@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
Customer Service Issue	@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.
Bad Flight	@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
Late Flight	@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
Late Flight	@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
Late Flight	@united worst AIRLINE  BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN  BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/
Late Flight	@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
Customer Service Issue	@united I know. I’m sure you hear it all the time — don’t like the new seats. I’m a small guy, 5’ 6” and I feel the new planes are tight
Late Flight	@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
Late Flight	@united delayed another hour
Lost Luggage	@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
Bad Flight	@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i’ll come back.
Late Flight	@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
Bad Flight	@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
Late Flight	@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
Lost Luggage	@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
Lost Luggage	@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
Customer Service Issue	@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
Lost Luggage	@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
Bad Flight	@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
Cancelled Flight	@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
Customer Service Issue	".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
Customer Service Issue	@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
Customer Service Issue	@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
Customer Service Issue	@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
Customer Service Issue	@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
Late Flight	@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
Customer Service Issue	@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
Customer Service Issue	@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
Bad Flight	@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
Late Flight	@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly
Bad Flight	@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
Customer Service Issue	@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
Late Flight	@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!
Late Flight	@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
Cancelled Flight	@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
Late Flight	.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
Customer Service Issue	@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
Late Flight	@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
Customer Service Issue	@united your customer service is crap.
Cancelled Flight	@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
Customer Service Issue	@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
Bad Flight	@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
Cancelled Flight	"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
Lost Luggage	@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
Bad Flight	@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
Customer Service Issue	@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
Customer Service Issue	@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
Customer Service Issue	@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
Customer Service Issue	@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
Customer Service Issue	@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
Customer Service Issue	@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
Late Flight	@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
Cancelled Flight	@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
Bad Flight	@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous
Late Flight	@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
Lost Luggage	@united 3 times my flight has been delayed and I miss my next flight. This time you've lost my baggage. No clean clothes. $337 flight. Thx!
Lost Luggage	@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
Late Flight	@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
Customer Service Issue	@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?
Late Flight	@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
Late Flight	@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
Customer Service Issue	@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
Bad Flight	@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
Late Flight	@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. 😒
Late Flight	@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
Customer Service Issue	@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
Customer Service Issue	@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
Late Flight	@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
Customer Service Issue	@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
Customer Service Issue	@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
Late Flight	@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
Customer Service Issue	@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
Late Flight	@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
Bad Flight	@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
Customer Service Issue	@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
Late Flight	@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
Cancelled Flight	@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
Late Flight	"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
Customer Service Issue	@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
Lost Luggage	@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
Lost Luggage	@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!
Customer Service Issue	@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
Customer Service Issue	@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
Customer Service Issue	@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
Late Flight	@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
Late Flight	@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
Lost Luggage	@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
Lost Luggage	@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united
Late Flight	@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.

Customer Service Issue	@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
Customer Service Issue	@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
Late Flight	@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?
Bad Flight	@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
Customer Service Issue	@united your customer service is terrible
Customer Service Issue	"@united define ""appreciate"". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback."
Customer Service Issue	@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
Late Flight	@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation
Cancelled Flight	@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?
Customer Service Issue	@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
Bad Flight	@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
Late Flight	.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
Customer Service Issue	@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
Customer Service Issue	@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
Customer Service Issue	@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
Bad Flight	@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
Lost Luggage	@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
Bad Flight	@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
Cancelled Flight	@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
Late Flight	@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
Cancelled Flight	@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
Cancelled Flight	@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
Late Flight	@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
Late Flight	@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
Customer Service Issue	@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
Customer Service Issue	@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
Late Flight	@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
Lost Luggage	@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
Cancelled Flight	"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
Lost Luggage	@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
Cancelled Flight	@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
Customer Service Issue	@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers
Customer Service Issue	@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
Late Flight	"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
Customer Service Issue	@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
Late Flight	@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
Late Flight	"@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac ""waiting for papers""... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !"
Customer Service Issue	@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
Bad Flight	@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49
Cancelled Flight	@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
Late Flight	@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
Customer Service Issue	@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
Late Flight	@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
Late Flight	@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
Lost Luggage	@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
Late Flight	@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
Customer Service Issue	@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
Lost Luggage	@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
Late Flight	@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
Customer Service Issue	@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
Customer Service Issue	Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals
Late Flight	@united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta
Customer Service Issue	@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
Customer Service Issue	@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
Late Flight	@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
Cancelled Flight	@united its in black and white. EU law and all that €600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
Customer Service Issue	@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
Customer Service Issue	"@united ""the extra care airline"". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1"
Late Flight	@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
Customer Service Issue	@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
Customer Service Issue	@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
Customer Service Issue	@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines
Late Flight	@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.
Lost Luggage	@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
Late Flight	@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
Bad Flight	@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
Customer Service Issue	@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
Late Flight	Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
Customer Service Issue	@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
Lost Luggage	@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
Customer Service Issue	@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
Late Flight	.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
Cancelled Flight	@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
Late Flight	@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
Lost Luggage	@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
Customer Service Issue	@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response
Bad Flight	@united  they were empty upon takeoff. Why can't someone sit there?
Customer Service Issue	@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
Lost Luggage	@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
Customer Service Issue	@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement.
Customer Service Issue	@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm
Customer Service Issue	@united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?
Late Flight	@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course
Cancelled Flight	@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled
Customer Service Issue	@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family
Cancelled Flight	@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
Late Flight	@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
Cancelled Flight	@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
Late Flight	@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
Cancelled Flight	@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
Late Flight	@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
Customer Service Issue	@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
Late Flight	@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
Late Flight	@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
Cancelled Flight	@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
Late Flight	@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
Late Flight	@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. 😞
Customer Service Issue	.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
Late Flight	@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
Customer Service Issue	@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
Late Flight	@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
Late Flight	@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
Late Flight	@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
Customer Service Issue	@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
Late Flight	@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡
Late Flight	@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
Late Flight	@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
Customer Service Issue	@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
Late Flight	@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
Customer Service Issue	@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
Lost Luggage	@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
Late Flight	@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
Late Flight	@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed.
Customer Service Issue	@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
Late Flight	@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
Late Flight	@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
Late Flight	@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
Late Flight	@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
Bad Flight	@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
Late Flight	@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
Customer Service Issue	@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
Customer Service Issue	@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
Late Flight	@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
Late Flight	@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
Late Flight	@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
Late Flight	@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
Late Flight	@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
Late Flight	@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
Cancelled Flight	@united silence is very telling
Late Flight	@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
Customer Service Issue	@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
Bad Flight	@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM
Customer Service Issue	@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK

Late Flight	@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
Late Flight	@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
Customer Service Issue	@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
Cancelled Flight	@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
Late Flight	"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont…
Customer Service Issue	@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
Late Flight	@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
Late Flight	@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
Bad Flight	@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
Late Flight	@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
Lost Luggage	@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
Late Flight	@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours. Frustrating!
Customer Service Issue	@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
Lost Luggage	@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
Cancelled Flight	@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
Bad Flight	@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
Customer Service Issue	@united service staff to is less than friendly!
Late Flight	@united Can you transfer my bags too?
Late Flight	@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
Late Flight	@united you had us REBOARD without the captain.  So now we'll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? http://t.co/EEReKDf9Fq

Late Flight	@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
Customer Service Issue	@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
Late Flight	@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
Customer Service Issue	@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
Late Flight	@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
Customer Service Issue	@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
Customer Service Issue	@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
Customer Service Issue	@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
Customer Service Issue	@united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
Customer Service Issue	@united installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn't let me back in. Four wasted hours.
Customer Service Issue	@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!
Customer Service Issue	@united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They've apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call.
Lost Luggage	@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
Bad Flight	@united seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great.
Customer Service Issue	"@united ""We like hearing from you."" So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi"
Late Flight	@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
Late Flight	@united As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers.
Late Flight	@united I'm not as sure as you are. http://t.co/HSMpbSF4UF
Customer Service Issue	@united how does that help me with my customers that I couldn't meet with (and subsequently lost)?
Customer Service Issue	@united problem is on laptop not phone
Customer Service Issue	@united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame.
Customer Service Issue	@united too long for 140 characters
Customer Service Issue	@united Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = 😔
Bad Flight	@united tried that already &amp; tried forgetting the wifi network connection. Still forces log in with incorrect email. Other suggestions?
Customer Service Issue	@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
Customer Service Issue	@united or did you mean 24-26?
Bad Flight	@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
Customer Service Issue	@United does a great job of answering public messages. Direct private messages, not so much.
Customer Service Issue	@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
Customer Service Issue	@united how's my refund coming along??
Late Flight	@united ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!?
Bad Flight	@united how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don't see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!!

Customer Service Issue	@united I sent you a dm hours ago
Lost Luggage	@united Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247.
Late Flight	@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
Customer Service Issue	@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
Bad Flight	@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
Late Flight	@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
Late Flight	@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am
Customer Service Issue	@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
Customer Service Issue	@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer.
Late Flight	@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
Customer Service Issue	@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
Customer Service Issue	@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
Customer Service Issue	@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
Lost Luggage	@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
Customer Service Issue	@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers.
Late Flight	@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
Customer Service Issue	@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
Late Flight	@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
Customer Service Issue	@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
Customer Service Issue	@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
Customer Service Issue	@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail
Lost Luggage	@united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
Late Flight	@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
Cancelled Flight	@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
Lost Luggage	@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened
Customer Service Issue	@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
Customer Service Issue	@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
Lost Luggage	@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
Late Flight	@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
Customer Service Issue	@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
Customer Service Issue	@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
Customer Service Issue	@united I’ve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
Late Flight	@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?
Cancelled Flight	@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight....
Late Flight	@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead
Cancelled Flight	@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless
Lost Luggage	@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
Customer Service Issue	@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
Bad Flight	@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
Bad Flight	@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
Customer Service Issue	@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
Late Flight	@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
Customer Service Issue	@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!
Customer Service Issue	@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated.
Cancelled Flight	@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
Customer Service Issue	@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
Late Flight	@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
Late Flight	@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
Customer Service Issue	@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho.
Customer Service Issue	@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
Customer Service Issue	@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
Customer Service Issue	@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
Customer Service Issue	@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
Customer Service Issue	@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
Lost Luggage	@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!

Bad Flight	@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
Late Flight	@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
Customer Service Issue	@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
Late Flight	@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting...
Late Flight	@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
Customer Service Issue	@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
Bad Flight	@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
Customer Service Issue	@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free.
Customer Service Issue	@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
Customer Service Issue	@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround
Late Flight	@united UA5029 from RIC, UA507 from ORD, &amp; UA423 from DEN -ALL DELAYED for non-weather issues. Way to go, youre batting 1.000! But no hotels
Customer Service Issue	@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
Customer Service Issue	@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
Bad Flight	@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
Late Flight	@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
Bad Flight	@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
Lost Luggage	@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
Customer Service Issue	"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
Customer Service Issue	@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
Customer Service Issue	@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
Customer Service Issue	@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
Lost Luggage	@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM
Bad Flight	@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
Bad Flight	@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.
Late Flight	@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
Cancelled Flight	@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
Customer Service Issue	@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
Lost Luggage	@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????
Customer Service Issue	@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
Lost Luggage	@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
Bad Flight	@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
Bad Flight	"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
Late Flight	@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
Late Flight	@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
Late Flight	@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
Lost Luggage	@united yes I have
Customer Service Issue	@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
Cancelled Flight	@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
Customer Service Issue	@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
Customer Service Issue	@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
Customer Service Issue	@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
Lost Luggage	@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
Late Flight	@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
Lost Luggage	@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
Customer Service Issue	@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
Bad Flight	@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
Customer Service Issue	@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
Lost Luggage	@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
Bad Flight	@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
Customer Service Issue	@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
Late Flight	@united It was quite enjoyable. 😊   Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. 😕
Bad Flight	@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded.
Cancelled Flight	@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ
Customer Service Issue	@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
Customer Service Issue	@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
Late Flight	@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection.
Lost Luggage	@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
Late Flight	@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
Late Flight	@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
Lost Luggage	@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
Lost Luggage	@united correct date is 2/11/15!
Customer Service Issue	@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
Lost Luggage	@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
Customer Service Issue	@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats.
Lost Luggage	@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
Late Flight	@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
Late Flight	@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
Bad Flight	@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
Late Flight	@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11
Bad Flight	"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
Cancelled Flight	@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
Late Flight	@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
Lost Luggage	@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
Customer Service Issue	@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
Cancelled Flight	@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
Cancelled Flight	@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
Customer Service Issue	@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to....
Late Flight	@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
Customer Service Issue	“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one.
Customer Service Issue	@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
Bad Flight	@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
Customer Service Issue	I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
Customer Service Issue	@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
Lost Luggage	@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed.
Cancelled Flight	@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
Cancelled Flight	@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
Lost Luggage	@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there.
Late Flight	"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
Lost Luggage	@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!
Late Flight	@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
Late Flight	@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
Customer Service Issue	@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
Cancelled Flight	@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
Customer Service Issue	@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
Lost Luggage	@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
Customer Service Issue	@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
Late Flight	@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
Late Flight	@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
Bad Flight	@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
Customer Service Issue	@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
Late Flight	@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
Bad Flight	@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
Lost Luggage	@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
Customer Service Issue	@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
Customer Service Issue	@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
Lost Luggage	@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
Lost Luggage	@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
Bad Flight	@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
Late Flight	"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
Late Flight	@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
Late Flight	@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
Late Flight	@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
Late Flight	@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
Bad Flight	@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
Late Flight	@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
Late Flight	@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
Cancelled Flight	@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?
Bad Flight	@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ
Bad Flight	@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
Late Flight	@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
Customer Service Issue	@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
Late Flight	@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
Lost Luggage	@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
Late Flight	@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
Customer Service Issue	@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
Bad Flight	@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
Customer Service Issue	"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
Customer Service Issue	@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
Lost Luggage	@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
Customer Service Issue	"@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible ""policies"".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now."
Cancelled Flight	@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
Bad Flight	1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
Late Flight	@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
Cancelled Flight	@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
Bad Flight	@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA
Customer Service Issue	@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate

Customer Service Issue	@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
Customer Service Issue	"@united yes, I know that. The question is ""why is that still the case""? #fail"
Bad Flight	@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX

Customer Service Issue	@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.

Lost Luggage	. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
Late Flight	@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
Customer Service Issue	@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
Customer Service Issue	@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
Late Flight	@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
Customer Service Issue	@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
Customer Service Issue	@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would.
Late Flight	@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
Customer Service Issue	@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.

Bad Flight	@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!
Lost Luggage	@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
Lost Luggage	@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
Late Flight	@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating

Customer Service Issue	@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
Customer Service Issue	@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
Customer Service Issue	"@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices"
Cancelled Flight	@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
Customer Service Issue	@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
Lost Luggage	@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
Late Flight	@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
Lost Luggage	@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
Lost Luggage	@united how come I have no baggage updates.
Bad Flight	@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?
Lost Luggage	@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
Late Flight	@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
Customer Service Issue	@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
Customer Service Issue	@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday
Lost Luggage	@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
Late Flight	@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.
Lost Luggage	@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
Lost Luggage	@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.

Cancelled Flight	@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
Late Flight	@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
Bad Flight	@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
Lost Luggage	@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)
Lost Luggage	@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
Customer Service Issue	@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
Late Flight	@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
Lost Luggage	@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
Lost Luggage	@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou

Lost Luggage	@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag!
Lost Luggage	@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
Customer Service Issue	@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result.
Customer Service Issue	@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
Customer Service Issue	@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
Customer Service Issue	@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
Bad Flight	@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
Customer Service Issue	@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won’t fix it?
Customer Service Issue	@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
Customer Service Issue	@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
Late Flight	@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
Late Flight	@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
Customer Service Issue	@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
Customer Service Issue	@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag. #flyunited
Customer Service Issue	@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
Late Flight	@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
Late Flight	@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
Late Flight	@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
Bad Flight	@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
Bad Flight	@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.
Customer Service Issue	@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
Late Flight	@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
Late Flight	@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
Late Flight	@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
Late Flight	@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
Bad Flight	@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.
Customer Service Issue	@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
Customer Service Issue	@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
Lost Luggage	@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
Customer Service Issue	@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
Customer Service Issue	@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
Lost Luggage	@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
Late Flight	@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
Customer Service Issue	I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
Late Flight	@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
Customer Service Issue	@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
Customer Service Issue	@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
Customer Service Issue	@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
Late Flight	@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
Late Flight	@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
Late Flight	@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
Customer Service Issue	@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
Customer Service Issue	@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
Late Flight	@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
Lost Luggage	@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
Late Flight	@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
Customer Service Issue	@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
Bad Flight	@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
Customer Service Issue	@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
Customer Service Issue	@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!
Lost Luggage	@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
Late Flight	@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
Late Flight	@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
Late Flight	@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
Customer Service Issue	"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
Customer Service Issue	@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
Cancelled Flight	@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
Customer Service Issue	@united Classic
Late Flight	@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
Customer Service Issue	@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
Customer Service Issue	"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
Customer Service Issue	@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
Customer Service Issue	@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
Late Flight	@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
Customer Service Issue	@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
Customer Service Issue	@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
Customer Service Issue	@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
Bad Flight	@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
Bad Flight	@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
Cancelled Flight	@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
Late Flight	@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times. If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
Customer Service Issue	@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
Customer Service Issue	@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
Late Flight	@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!
Customer Service Issue	@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
Lost Luggage	@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
Customer Service Issue	@united worst service ever 😈
Customer Service Issue	@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
Late Flight	@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..😡...
Late Flight	@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
Customer Service Issue	@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
Late Flight	@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
Cancelled Flight	@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
Late Flight	@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
Lost Luggage	@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
Cancelled Flight	@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
Bad Flight	@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
Customer Service Issue	@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
Customer Service Issue	@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
Customer Service Issue	@united customer service 👎
Customer Service Issue	@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
Cancelled Flight	@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.

Late Flight	@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
Late Flight	@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
Lost Luggage	@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.
Customer Service Issue	@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
Lost Luggage	@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
Customer Service Issue	@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
Cancelled Flight	@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
Cancelled Flight	@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
Cancelled Flight	@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
Customer Service Issue	@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
Customer Service Issue	@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
Late Flight	@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
Late Flight	@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
Lost Luggage	@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
Lost Luggage	@united who can tell me where they are?
Cancelled Flight	@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
Bad Flight	@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
Late Flight	@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
Customer Service Issue	@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
Late Flight	@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
Late Flight	@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
Late Flight	@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
Customer Service Issue	@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
Lost Luggage	@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
Customer Service Issue	@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
Customer Service Issue	@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
Lost Luggage	@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
Bad Flight	@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
Customer Service Issue	@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
Late Flight	@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
Lost Luggage	@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
Bad Flight	@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
Late Flight	@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
Late Flight	@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
Bad Flight	@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
Late Flight	@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
Late Flight	@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
Lost Luggage	@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
Customer Service Issue	@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
Customer Service Issue	@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
Customer Service Issue	@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
Customer Service Issue	@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?
Late Flight	@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem
Cancelled Flight	@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
Cancelled Flight	@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
Cancelled Flight	.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
Customer Service Issue	@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
Late Flight	@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
Late Flight	@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!
Late Flight	@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
Customer Service Issue	@united why am i mot getting my refund?
Bad Flight	@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
Customer Service Issue	@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
Customer Service Issue	@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
Bad Flight	@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
Late Flight	.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
Late Flight	@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on
Lost Luggage	@united i have items of sentimental value that I'm heartbroken are missing
Customer Service Issue	@united still waiting for a reply
Bad Flight	@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
Customer Service Issue	@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
Customer Service Issue	@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
Late Flight	@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
Bad Flight	@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
Late Flight	@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
Late Flight	@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!

Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac

Late Flight	@SouthwestAir your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it's changed, so is that reliable information?
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what's worse, 2nd time this winter.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir @TaylorLumsden Taylor.  U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh?
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights.
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir prove it
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
Cancelled Flight	"@SouthwestAir weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.."
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.

Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!

Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward
Bad Flight	@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help.
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
Lost Luggage	"@SouthwestAir It was never really ""lost"" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!"
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
Customer Service Issue	.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again
Cancelled Flight	"But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for ""weather.""  We flew home on weatherless @united."

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
Bad Flight	@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
Lost Luggage	@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..

Late Flight	@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
Bad Flight	@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
Late Flight	"@SouthwestAir, got ""duped"" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful"

Late Flight	@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.

Late Flight	5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS”
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir it's the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!!
Late Flight	.@SouthwestAir 3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir it's ok...I forgive you guys.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns.
Bad Flight	@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse

Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight out of BNA today. Been on hold for an hour. 😠 #frustrated!
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir can't update my flight online bc it's been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir Guys for real. I've been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back.
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir been on hold for &gt;30 minutes about my Cancelled Flightled flight. Still not talked to anyone and flight is soon. What gives?

Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home.
Cancelled Flight	@SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir won't answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone
Late Flight	@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
Customer Service Issue	@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 more👺
Late Flight	"@JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we've received for our ""on time"" flight 1170 out of MCO"
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue luggage fees? won't b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter
Bad Flight	@JetBlue your wifi is a lie and i hate you
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue 's Once upon a sale that does not include BTV, as usual!  #jetbluehatesbtv
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly @Delta again, dont do it!
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue I just DM'd you!
Late Flight	@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
Late Flight	@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
Late Flight	@JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue, I've experienced better service making connecting flight from @united and @AmericanAir #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can't fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.
Late Flight	@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
Late Flight	@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
Late Flight	@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?
Late Flight	@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
Bad Flight	@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue that's not a answer!
Late Flight	@JetBlue well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time.
Late Flight	@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
Cancelled Flight	"@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for ""weather"" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?"
Late Flight	@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
Late Flight	@JetBlue we're home, you guys recovered, now we can laugh about it and the extra day in barbados. Will you open Cuba soon?
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can't seem to rebook me. They can't even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted.
Late Flight	"@JetBlue Gotcha... but ""lessening the delay"" ... that part's not happening, right?"
Late Flight	@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
Late Flight	@JetBlue once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don't fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_-
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers.
Late Flight	@JetBlue three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen. At least a heads up so you could download a movie
Bad Flight	@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
Late Flight	Noooo don't do it, please don't do it 😩RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lsxJI0oUvR”
Bad Flight	@JetBlue We had some major plane-wide DirectTV issues yesterday. System kept being reset by crew member.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Not helping since there's a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time.
Late Flight	@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.
Late Flight	@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated
Cancelled Flight	STOP THIS “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Ac6zwmuOOn”
Customer Service Issue	"Stop the madness ""@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Q5a7jtkI5K”"
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!?  You're  now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I'm praying I don't miss the flight!
Late Flight	We didn't need this. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cpZB285o71
Late Flight	@JetBlue any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
Customer Service Issue	Why @JetBlue let someone from black Twitter in their multimedia department?
Bad Flight	nope. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/9SHhTvIOTI
Bad Flight	@JetBlue what else on this plane is duct-taped?? #ohboy #shouldigetoutandpush #airplane #flying… http://t.co/R9ZsVzuRLw
Late Flight	@JetBlue Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :(
Bad Flight	@JetBlue someone should screen what you play on your flights. http://t.co/tNY9uIpha5
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
Late Flight	@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right.
Late Flight	@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:""your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins"" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!"
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site.
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue I would like to communicate directly with a ""Customer Experience"" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address?"
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
Bad Flight	@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
Late Flight	@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
Late Flight	"@JetBlue lol at your ""estimated departure time."" Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right."
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. 😒
Bad Flight	@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
Late Flight	@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
Late Flight	@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting ""Webpage not available"" after submitting online form"
Late Flight	@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
Bad Flight	@jetblue terrible landing on 915
Late Flight	@JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people.
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was ""There is nothing we can do"" idk if that's what you mean"
Late Flight	@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
Late Flight	@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
Late Flight	@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
Late Flight	@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
Late Flight	@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
Bad Flight	@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
Late Flight	@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i
Late Flight	@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
Late Flight	@JetBlue 👍. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
Late Flight	@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
Bad Flight	@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi😭 why dont you guys go to maimi???
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
Late Flight	@JetBlue thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
Bad Flight	@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
Bad Flight	@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
Late Flight	@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
Late Flight	@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
Late Flight	Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
Late Flight	@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
Late Flight	@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
Bad Flight	@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
Cancelled Flight	".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
Late Flight	@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification
Late Flight	@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
Lost Luggage	"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
Late Flight	@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
Late Flight	@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
Late Flight	@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
Late Flight	@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
Late Flight	@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
Late Flight	@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
Late Flight	@JetBlue all day
Late Flight	@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
Late Flight	@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
Late Flight	@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
Late Flight	@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
Customer Service Issue	"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
Bad Flight	@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
Bad Flight	@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger
Late Flight	@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
Late Flight	@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
Bad Flight	@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
Bad Flight	@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
Bad Flight	"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
Late Flight	@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2
Late Flight	@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
Late Flight	@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
Late Flight	@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
Late Flight	@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
Late Flight	@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
Late Flight	@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
Late Flight	@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
Bad Flight	@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS
Late Flight	@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
Late Flight	@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
Late Flight	@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
Bad Flight	@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
Late Flight	@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
Late Flight	@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
Late Flight	@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
Late Flight	@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! 😕
Late Flight	@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
Late Flight	@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
Late Flight	@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
Late Flight	@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
Late Flight	@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
Late Flight	@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
Late Flight	@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
Late Flight	@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
Late Flight	@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
Late Flight	.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
Late Flight	@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
Late Flight	@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
Late Flight	@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
Late Flight	@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
Late Flight	@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
Late Flight	@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
Late Flight	@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue, your hold music sucks.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
Late Flight	@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
Late Flight	@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
Late Flight	@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
Late Flight	@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
Late Flight	@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
Late Flight	@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
Late Flight	@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO
Late Flight	@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
Late Flight	@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
Late Flight	@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
Late Flight	@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
Bad Flight	@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
Late Flight	@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
Late Flight	@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
Late Flight	@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
Late Flight	@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
Late Flight	@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
Late Flight	@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
Late Flight	@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
Late Flight	@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
Late Flight	"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
Late Flight	@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?

Late Flight	@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!

Late Flight	@JetBlue flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible
Late Flight	@jetblue all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you...
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue why don't YOU tell them to update the boards?!
Late Flight	@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
Late Flight	@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ

Late Flight	@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒
Bad Flight	@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
Late Flight	@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this
Late Flight	@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I am But Your customer service is Brutal.

Lost Luggage	@JetBlue she has...she hasn't heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎

Late Flight	@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
Late Flight	@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything.
Late Flight	@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least.

Late Flight	@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
Customer Service Issue	.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
Late Flight	.@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy !
Late Flight	@JetBlue flight1407, it's been a long day! Arrived from London at 11 this morning
Late Flight	@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats
Late Flight	@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed.
Late Flight	@JetBlue, why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? 💔

Late Flight	@JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. 👎
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue can't seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP
Late Flight	@JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue
Late Flight	@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
Late Flight	@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
Late Flight	@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!
Late Flight	@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
Late Flight	@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
Late Flight	@JetBlue I ❤️ Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done?
Late Flight	@JetBlue sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening's is starting w delays. Why?
Late Flight	@JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can't drive or see in my classes and they're not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue
Late Flight	@JetBlue we've been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I've had good luck, but today is really frustrating.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue we've been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572
Late Flight	@JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof
Customer Service Issue	@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me
Late Flight	@JetBlue mechanical failure isn't Boston' fault.

Late Flight	I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I've settled some @JetBlue
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line. Please see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance.
Late Flight	@JetBlue don't just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. .
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there's no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue
Bad Flight	@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
Bad Flight	@JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding
Late Flight	@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/
Late Flight	@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
Late Flight	@JetBlue Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I'll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer
Late Flight	@JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated
Late Flight	@JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
Late Flight	@JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
Late Flight	@JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I'm all for erring on the side of safety but it's an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!!
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue it's ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight.
Late Flight	@JetBlue I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this?
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue your airline should have a better system to Inform your clients when their flights are Cancelled Flightled last min. 😒👺 we have schedules too
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue - In CA for the weekend to attend a training camp; thanks for sending all my gear to FL; looks like this trip is a waste #nothappy
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue and stranded passengers aren't being helped to get another flight?
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
Bad Flight	@JetBlue I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
Bad Flight	@JetBlue on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue #poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
Lost Luggage	"@JetBlue the one man in baggage office says ""I dunno"". HELP"

Lost Luggage	@JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue service for baggage at JFK is incomprehensible. No employee knows where our luggage is frM flight 424 LAX to NYC ITS AN HR WAIT NOW
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue #669 stewardesses can't work w/o a galley light! Back to NYC to change a light. #fromthefrontseat #jetblueBlues @anku @yaffasolin

Late Flight	@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
Customer Service Issue	@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
Late Flight	@JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired
Bad Flight	@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
Late Flight	@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
Late Flight	@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
Late Flight	@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
Late Flight	@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
Late Flight	@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
Late Flight	@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
Late Flight	@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
Bad Flight	@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔
Late Flight	@JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
Bad Flight	@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
Late Flight	@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
Late Flight	@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
Late Flight	@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...
Late Flight	@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now!
Late Flight	@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
Late Flight	"@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
Late Flight	@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
Late Flight	@JetBlue what's up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux?
Bad Flight	@JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded
Bad Flight	@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
Late Flight	@JetBlue dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying.
Late Flight	@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.

Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer

Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??

Bad Flight	@JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.

Late Flight	@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!

Bad Flight	@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
Late Flight	@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza

Late Flight	@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.

Late Flight	@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting.
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service

Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number.
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :(
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2
Late Flight	@JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail

Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
Customer Service Issue	Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I'll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
Bad Flight	@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?

Late Flight	@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
Lost Luggage	@JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then ""mailbox has not been set up yet."" Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon"
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue  But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service.
Late Flight	@JetBlue why are we delayed :( flight 1601
Customer Service Issue	"@JetBlue continue button generated a trip to ""plan your trip page"" regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems process hint: the end of it"

Late Flight	@JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection
Cancelled Flight	@JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting
Late Flight	@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
Customer Service Issue	@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
Late Flight	@JetBlue Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
Late Flight	@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays

Lost Luggage	@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.

Lost Luggage	@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would.

Lost Luggage	@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
Customer Service Issue	.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.
Bad Flight	@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).

Customer Service Issue	"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."""
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
Bad Flight	@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
Late Flight	@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
Late Flight	@USAirways what is the damn delay????
Late Flight	@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
Customer Service Issue	@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
Bad Flight	@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.
Late Flight	@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
Late Flight	@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
Late Flight	@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
Bad Flight	@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
Late Flight	@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
Late Flight	@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
Lost Luggage	@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
Late Flight	@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
Late Flight	@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
Bad Flight	@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
Late Flight	@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
Bad Flight	@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
Late Flight	@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
Late Flight	@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
Late Flight	@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.

Late Flight	@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
Late Flight	@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
Bad Flight	@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
Bad Flight	@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice

Late Flight	@USAirways Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC.

Late Flight	@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response??????
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks
Late Flight	@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
Lost Luggage	@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
Lost Luggage	@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
Lost Luggage	@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
Late Flight	@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
Lost Luggage	@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
Lost Luggage	@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
Cancelled Flight	@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher
Late Flight	@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.
Lost Luggage	@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
Lost Luggage	@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
Late Flight	Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
Late Flight	@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
Customer Service Issue	@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
Late Flight	@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
Lost Luggage	@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
Late Flight	@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!
Customer Service Issue	@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.
Bad Flight	@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
Customer Service Issue	@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
Late Flight	@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways your agent did not say
Lost Luggage	@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho
Bad Flight	@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
Lost Luggage	@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.

Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies.

Customer Service Issue	@usairways I’m cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
Cancelled Flight	@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!
Customer Service Issue	@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse.
Bad Flight	@USAirways any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;(

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
Customer Service Issue	"@AmericanAir stop sending me back to ""customer relations ""I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!"
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day

Late Flight	@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate w/companies forU!
Late Flight	@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
Late Flight	@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman
Customer Service Issue	Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength “@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?”
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
Late Flight	@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir  Hello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths
Late Flight	@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
Late Flight	@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
Late Flight	"@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for ""rampers"" #AA4285"
Lost Luggage	"@AmericanAir Just got a call from baggage dept. ""...still looking for your property"". It's went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!!"
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom
Late Flight	@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I'm getting different reports?
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
Late Flight	@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?
Bad Flight	"@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. ""We will take off soon."" Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW."
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn't help me.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
Late Flight	“@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.”#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
Late Flight	@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
Customer Service Issue	"@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a ""we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"""
Late Flight	@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don't have time to do that. #terrible
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir That’s a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn’t understand e-mail 101.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can't file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes....
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd
Late Flight	.@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.
Late Flight	.@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded...
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I'm trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
Late Flight	@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude 😡😡
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
Lost Luggage	"@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to""arrange pick up""in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!"
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they'd call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!!
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It's a very small item.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir I'll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ❤️ these earrings!!
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas.  Baggage was only checked to ORD.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks
Late Flight	@AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation.
Customer Service Issue	Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
Late Flight	@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
Customer Service Issue	Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. 👎😡✈️ #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let's try this again!!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
Customer Service Issue	.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting now to be connected to an agent
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn't. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH 😁

Cancelled Flight	"@AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah ""I"" got it rebooked"
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir So break whatever you want, take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew @chicagotribune @WSJ #nytimes @CNN

Late Flight	@AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable
Late Flight	@AmericanAir what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot .
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. http://t.co/I7Vdi9WqSF
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
Late Flight	@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
Late Flight	@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
Cancelled Flight	"@AmericanAir ""sorry you were disappointed"" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs"
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
Late Flight	@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry
Late Flight	@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
Cancelled Flight	"Without notifying though? “@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."""
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir im still on hold...
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
Customer Service Issue	"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
Late Flight	@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.

Late Flight	@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.

Cancelled Flight	"@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they ""couldn't staff the plane"""

Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault

Cancelled Flight	"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?
Lost Luggage	"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
Customer Service Issue	@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny
Late Flight	@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
Late Flight	@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
Customer Service Issue	"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane 😢😕😦 #AmericanAirlines
Late Flight	@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful 😳
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
Cancelled Flight	@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you’ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
Cancelled Flight	"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer...

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
Bad Flight	"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
Late Flight	@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
Late Flight	@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
Customer Service Issue	Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one plane😡
Late Flight	@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
Bad Flight	@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
Customer Service Issue	"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
Late Flight	@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
Late Flight	@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS
Late Flight	@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
Late Flight	@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
Late Flight	@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!

Late Flight	@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded

Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?
Late Flight	@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
Lost Luggage	@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!

Late Flight	@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
Late Flight	@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
Late Flight	@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.

Customer Service Issue	"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
Cancelled Flight	@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
Late Flight	@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
Customer Service Issue	@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
